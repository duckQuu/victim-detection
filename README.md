# Disaster Victim Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains a deep learning project for detecting and locating victims in disaster scenarios using image data. Developed as part of an ongoing research effort, this model is designed to assist in rapid response and search-and-rescue operations by identifying potential victims in challenging visual conditions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a robust image classification and localization model for disaster victim detection. Key components include:
1. **Data Collection and Augmentation**: Preparing a dataset to simulate real-world disaster environments.
2. **Model Development**: Building and training a deep learning model capable of detecting victims in diverse settings.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Measuring model performance to ensure reliability and accuracy.
4. **Deployment**: Outlining future steps for integrating the model into practical applications.

## Key Steps and Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation and Augmentation

Given the challenging nature of detecting victims in various scenarios, the project uses data augmentation techniques to improve the modelâ€™s generalization:
- **Rotation**, **Scaling**, **Flipping**, and **Color Adjustments** to mimic different conditions such as debris, smoke, and variable lighting.

Augmentation is crucial for creating a resilient model capable of handling diverse and unexpected visual inputs.

### 2. Model Architecture

The model is based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, optimized for image classification and object detection. Key layers and modules include:
- **Convolutional Layers** for extracting important visual features.
- **Batch Normalization** and **Dropout Layers** for regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Final Classification Layer** with softmax activation for multi-class victim detection.

This architecture balances efficiency and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time detection applications.

### 3. Training and Evaluation

The model is trained on the augmented dataset and evaluated using metrics critical for search-and-rescue tasks:
- **Accuracy**: Overall detection accuracy.
- **Precision** and **Recall**: Measures of detection relevance and completeness.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides class-wise detection insights.

### 4. Deployment Strategy

The model is designed with potential deployment in mind, including:
- **Edge Deployment**: Optimizing for deployment on edge devices (e.g., drones or rescue robots).
- **Cloud API**: Configuring a cloud-based API for centralized detection and alerting.
